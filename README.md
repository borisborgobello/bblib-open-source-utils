### Author

Author : Boris Borgobello

I'm an all moutain developer that has been working with many languages. 
Usually, as I code I will slowly create utils classes, scripts and sometimes even libraries / modules.

I have created this git to share some of my code. Code that I have rights upon, that is no longer critical, and that I wish to share with the community.
It is not intended for pull requests/improvements. However feel free to criticize it or send a message to me whenever you feel necessary. There is most of the time space for improvements and I do wish to know it ;).
